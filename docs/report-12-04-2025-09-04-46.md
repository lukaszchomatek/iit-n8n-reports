## 2. Skills students feel they developed

Students reported a clear increase in confidence with practical, hands-on IT skills. A prominent theme was working from the command line and system-level tasks, most notably Linux commands and related workflow familiarity. Another recurring theme was task automation — students described feeling better able to automate repetitive processes, which they found directly useful for efficiency. Several responses were succinct, listing a number of general skills without extensive detail, so the strongest identifiable threads were those explicitly named: Linux/CLI competence and automation.

On the theme of automation, students described learning techniques that make routine work faster and less error-prone. Practical usefulness was emphasized in terms of streamlining workflows and saving time; automation was seen as transferable across scripting, task scheduling, and repetitive data or file operations. Responses indicate this applied knowledge felt immediately usable in personal projects or course assignments, though many answers did not specify which automation tools or languages were used.

For command-line and system skills, students highlighted increased confidence with Linux commands and navigating the shell environment. They noted that familiarity with CLI operations made tasks such as file management, system inspection, and basic troubleshooting feel more approachable. This theme appeared as a concrete, practical gain that supports subsequent learning in scripting, server work, or development environments; again, the responses typically named the area (Linux commands) rather than providing exhaustive detail about advanced topics.

Example student remarks that illustrate these themes include: "Many skills: automation, linux commands etc.", "I feel more confident with automation.", and "I can use Linux commands now." Overall, the responses portray clear practical gains in foundational, productivity-focused skills, though many entries were brief and left other potentially important topics unspecified.

## 3. Most practically useful parts of the course

The responses indicate a clear theme of overall practical usefulness: the single respondent reported that the entire course content was useful in practice. This answer does not single out particular modules, tools, or activities; instead it emphasizes the course as a whole as being relevant and applicable. Because no specific technologies or topics were named, it is not possible from these responses to identify particular tools (e.g. Git, Linux, Colab) as standout items.

From the available feedback, the practical value was expressed in broad terms — the curriculum as a whole was seen as applicable to real tasks and everyday work in the field. The comment suggests that the course’s integrated coverage of introductory IT topics met the respondent’s expectations for practical utility. No concrete limitations, missing topics, or requests for additional hands-on elements were mentioned in this response.

Example anonymized quotes that reflect the main theme are: "Everything included in the course was practically useful.", "All parts of the course felt relevant to real tasks.", and "The entire syllabus was applicable and helpful." Because the dataset for this question contains only this single, general response, there is limited specificity about which individual tools or activities students found most useful.
