## 2. Skills students feel they developed

Students reported clear gains in AI literacy, command-line proficiency, version control familiarity, and some experience with automation. Several responses emphasized the ability to detect and reason about bias in AI outputs, noting that the lectures made them more alert to problematic or skewed responses. Several students also singled out practical, hands-on skills: the Linux command line and the Git/GitHub ecosystem were repeatedly mentioned as areas of increased confidence. A smaller number of students referenced task automation, and one response expressed broad confidence across all the tools covered.

On AI and bias, students found it practically useful to learn how to spot bias and question model outputs before trusting them for tasks. The responses indicate that people are now more comfortable identifying when an AI answer may reflect biased training data or questionable assumptions, which they see as immediately applicable when using large language models or other AI tools. Several comments used language like "recognition of AI bias" and "finding biases in AI responses," showing that critical evaluation rather than blind acceptance was a salient takeaway. Fewer responses described concrete strategies for mitigating bias, so applying corrective workflows appeared less prominent than detection skills.

In terms of foundational IT tools, many students reported increased confidence with Linux commands and with Git/GitHub. The practical usefulness here was described in terms of everyday development workflows: navigating the terminal, manipulating files, using version control, and engaging with the broader GitHub ecosystem for collaboration and project management. These skills were framed as directly helpful for future coursework and team projects, and several students called out "linux commands" and "Github/Github ecosystem" as specific, tangible gains.

Task automation was a smaller theme but still present: a few students mentioned automation as a useful outcome from the course, suggesting they feel better equipped to streamline repetitive tasks. One respondent summarized a more general sentiment with "i feel very confident about all the tools shown on the lecture," which reflects an overall sense of preparedness among some students. Overall, strengths were concentrated in bias recognition, command-line usage, and version control; automation and explicit bias-mitigation techniques were less frequently cited, indicating potential areas that were either less emphasized or less retained in student feedback.

Example quotes: "recognition of AI bias"; "finding biases in AI responses"; "linux commands"; "Github".

## 3. Most practically useful parts of the course

Students most often highlighted workflow automation as the single most practically useful part of the course. Many responses named n8n explicitly and others mentioned general “possibilities of task automation” or Outlook rules; students described these topics as directly applicable to reducing repetitive work, connecting different services, and automating routine email and data-handling tasks. The practical appeal was that these tools can be applied immediately to personal or team workflows, so students felt they gained concrete, time-saving techniques rather than purely theoretical knowledge.

A second clear theme was the use of AI/assistant tools, with several students citing Notebook LM as particularly useful. These responses singled out the tool itself as something they could put to use for managing content and interacting with language models; students treated it as a hands-on resource introduced by the course rather than abstract discussion. While fewer students wrote about this than about automation platforms, Notebook LM appeared consistently enough to be a notable practical takeaway.

A smaller number of students mentioned foundational system and administrative topics as valuable. A few respondents pointed to learning Linux commands as a concretely useful skill for file management, scripting and working in terminal environments. Others noted practical, less technical topics such as software licences and Outlook rules; these responses suggest some appreciation for non-programming practicalities like compliance and email automation that support day-to-day work.

Representative comments from the survey illustrate these themes: "n8n", "possibilities of task automation", "Notebook LM", "linux commands". Overall the feedback emphasizes tools and practices that students can apply immediately; the responses were largely focused on practical utility rather than theoretical depth.
