## 2. Skills students feel they developed

Students reported gains across a few clear practical areas. The most frequently mentioned theme was version control and repository work, specifically Git and GitHub: many students said they feel more comfortable navigating repositories, performing basic GitHub operations, and using version control in group projects. This was often cited as directly useful for collaboration and for managing code and documents; students noted that familiarity with GitHub made it easier to contribute to group assignments and track changes. Several responses emphasized increased openness to exploring other development tools as a result of this experience.

Another prominent theme was interactive notebooks and cloud environments: several students referenced NotebookLM and Google Colab as tools they now know how to use. These students found them practically useful for running code, organizing work, and leveraging AI-assisted note-taking or code-help features; some noted that these platforms make experimenting with code and models more accessible without local setup. A smaller but notable group highlighted data-analysis skills and automation — for example, performing basic analyses or scripting routine tasks — as concrete outcomes they feel more confident about after the course.

Command-line and system-level skills also appeared across the responses. Several students mentioned basics of Linux and using Linux commands for tasks like writing and filtering text, which they found useful for file manipulation and preprocessing. AI-related skills were another recurring theme: multiple students reported increased confidence in using or detecting AI tools, and in trying AI-augmented applications. Collaboration and working within a digital team environment came up as a practical benefit for a few students, who appreciated learning workflows that support remote or asynchronous teamwork. A few respondents simply reported greater general confidence using a computer or awareness of tool existence rather than mastery.

While most comments were positive about practical gains, some students expressed limitations or ongoing uncertainty. Several noted that knowing a tool exists is not the same as full confidence using it, and that they continue to discover new features and areas for improvement; one response explicitly framed confidence as provisional because there is always more to learn. Representative short quotes reflect the main themes: "Using GitHub", "NotebookLM usage", "Writing and filtering with Linux commands", "Using and detecting AI", "Data analysing is the skill I am the most confident after the course." These quotations illustrate both the breadth of tools covered and the mixed depth of confidence students currently feel.

## 3. Most practically useful parts of the course

Students most frequently identified two concrete tools as the most practically useful parts of the course: NotebookLM and Git/GitHub. Many students singled out NotebookLM as a helpful, immediately usable aid for studying and for applying AI to routine tasks. Many others emphasized learning GitHub workflows and basic version-control operations as directly relevant to future work. These two themes dominated the responses and were often mentioned as the parts of the course they expect to use again.

On NotebookLM, students described practical benefits for study and task support, noting that the tool made exploring and applying AI more accessible. Typical comments were short and consistent: "NotebookLM was interesting and useful," "Introduction to the notebook LM, i think it is very useful tool, which maybe useful in the future to study," and "The notebookLM and overall use if ai in different tasks." Several students framed NotebookLM as a study aid rather than a development platform, appreciating its immediate applicability.

Git and GitHub were also highlighted by many respondents for hands-on skills such as git pull, issue filing, collaboration in repositories, and using Codespaces. Students reported finding the introduction and practice with GitHub valuable for group work, presentations, and prospective job tasks: "Learning git hub (possibly for our future job)" and "I had no idea how to use git hub." At the same time a few students noted limitations in coverage — for example that many advanced or convenience features of git were "barely touched" even though core VCS duties were covered — indicating that depth in some areas could have been greater.

Other practical topics emerged less frequently but still meaningfully: several students pointed to Linux commands and GNU core utilities, automation tools such as n8n, and exposure to AI models and automations in GitHub as useful takeaways. Comments like "GNU Coreutilities," "Using GitHub or n8n," and "Probably telling the AI to automate tasks for you in github" illustrate these secondary themes. Across the responses there was a generally positive view of the course’s practical value, while a minority of comments signaled that certain advanced features or deeper treatment of tools were not fully explored.
