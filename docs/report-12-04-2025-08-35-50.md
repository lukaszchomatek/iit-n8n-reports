## 2. Skills students feel they developed

Students reported increased confidence across a few clear areas: recognizing bias in AI outputs, using the Linux command line, working within the GitHub ecosystem, and automating routine tasks. The most frequently mentioned theme was the ability to detect and think critically about biases in AI-generated content; several students also highlighted practical technical skills such as command-line usage, while a smaller but noticeable group mentioned version-control workflows and task automation. These themes reflect both conceptual understanding (evaluating AI behavior) and hands-on competencies (tools and workflows).

Many students said they feel better equipped to spot biased or problematic responses from AI systems. They described gaining practical methods for identifying when an AI’s output may be skewed or one-sided and for treating model responses with more scrutiny. This increased awareness was framed as immediately useful for assessing the reliability and fairness of AI tools used in coursework and projects.

A number of students reported improved confidence with Linux commands and the command-line environment, which they found practically useful for development, file management, and interfacing with other tools. Several responses also emphasized familiarity with the GitHub ecosystem—covering version control, repositories, and collaborative workflows—which students found helpful for sharing code and tracking changes. A few students specifically mentioned task automation as a skill they now feel more comfortable with, seeing it as a way to streamline repetitive work and improve productivity.

Example comments that illustrate these themes include: "recognition of AI bias", "finding biases in AI responses", "linux commands", "Github ecosystem", and "task automation". Overall, responses concentrated most strongly on AI bias recognition and command-line skills, with additional but smaller clusters of interest around GitHub and automation.

## 3. Most practically useful parts of the course

Students most frequently highlighted workflow automation with n8n as the most practically useful part of the course; several students mentioned n8n specifically and emphasized its applicability to automating routine tasks and integrating different services. Beyond automation, a smaller but distinct group found tools for working with large-language-model–driven note systems (Notebook LM) helpful for organizing information and drafting content. Other single-topic mentions included basic Linux command-line skills, Outlook rules for email management, and software licences, each described as directly useful in day-to-day academic or administrative work.

Regarding n8n, students noted practical benefits such as being able to design end-to-end automations without heavy programming, connecting cloud services, and reducing repetitive manual steps. The appeal was largely pragmatic: being able to prototype workflows quickly and embed them into regular tasks. This theme was relatively strong compared with other items in the survey and appeared across different student backgrounds, indicating broad perceived utility of low-code automation platforms.

Notebook LM, Linux commands, and Outlook rules were each cited by a few students as immediately useful. Notebook LM was appreciated for helping structure notes and draft material with model assistance, while Linux commands were valued for basic system navigation and scripting tasks that support development workflows. Outlook rules were mentioned as a straightforward way to manage incoming email and improve personal productivity. These topics were less commonly cited than n8n but still notable for their tangible, everyday usefulness.

A few students also raised licences as a practical consideration, indicating awareness of legal and administrative aspects of using software. Example anonymized quotes that reflect the main themes include: "n8n", "linux commands", "Notebook LM", "Outlook rules", and "licences". Overall, the responses emphasize practical tools and small-scope skills that students can apply immediately, while also suggesting that several useful topics were each only mentioned by a few respondents, implying varied exposure or differing priorities among the cohort.
